# 10 min Survey: Rate Synthesised Voices

Brief description: (Please read all of this carefully)

In this survey you will listen and rate some synthesised audios. The audios are quite bad (contain weird sound artefacts and noise) because we used some old-school tools (unit selection). Compare the three different audios for each question to make clear which audios suck the least.

To complete this survey you will need: your phone, headphones and a computer.

Quick guide: 

- Download the "audio_files" folder. This folder contains 5 subfolders (Wheat_audios, Corn_audios, etc) and each of them have 3 audio files (Voice A, B and C).
- Open the survey on your phone and connect your headphones to your laptop to listen to the files.
- Not all questions ask for the same thing! Please read each question carefully.
- At the begining of each question a specific subfolder is specified (Wheat_audios, Corn_audios, etc), listen and compare all of the audio files.
- Listening to all the audios takes less than 5 min, so please take your time and relisten to them if necessary when comparing.

Sankiu for participating!
