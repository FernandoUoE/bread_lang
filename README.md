# 10 min Survey: Rate Synthesised Voices!

Brief description: (Please read all of this carefully)

In this survey you will listen and rate some synthesised audios. The audios are quite bad (contain weird sound artefacts and noise) because we used some old-school tools (unit selection). Compare the three different audios for each question to make clear which audios suck the least.

To complete this survey you will need: your phone, headphones and a computer.

Quick guide: 

- Download the "audio_files" folder. This folder contains 5 subfolders (Wheat_audios, Corn_audios, etc) and each of them have 3 audio files (Voice A, B and C).
- Open the survey on your phone and connect your headphones to your laptop to listen to the files.
- Not all questions ask for the same thing! Please read each question carefully.
- At the begining of each question a specific subfolder is specified (Wheat_audios, Corn_audios, etc), listen and compare all of the audio files.
- Listening to all the audios takes less than 5 min, so please take your time and relisten to them if necessary when comparing.

Sankiu for participating!


Extra guide:

Help with Github:
To download the audio_files you have to click on the green "<>Code" button and then "Download ZIP". This will download all the files as a zip file to your Downloads folder and you might need to unzip the folder before being able to listen to the audios. If you don't understand something just send me a message and I will help you out.

Help with the survey:
Each question tells you which subfolder (Wheat_audios, Corn_audios, etc) you should listen to. Read the whole question to fully understand what you are rating. The transcription is there to indicate what the input text was and to help you decide which audio sounds the least. The slides for each question can be dragged from 0 (very bad) to 100 (very good). If all the questions suck equally indicate that by having the bars at the same number, but try your best to differentiate between them.
